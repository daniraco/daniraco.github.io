  abstract={In this paper, we present a training technique of a Recurrent Radial Basis Function neural network for fault prediction. We use the Fuzzy Min‐Max technique to initialize the k‐center of the RRBF neural network. The k‐means algorithm is then applied to calculate the centers that minimize the mean square error of the prediction task. The performances of the k‐means algorithm are then boosted by the Fuzzy Min‐Max technique.}
