  abstract={Cutaneous melanoma is an invasive cancer with a worldwide annual death toll of 57,000 (Arnold et al., JAMA Dermatol 2022). Changes in the tumor microenvironment, including the evolution of the metabolic states, have been suggested to be associated with poor chemotherapeutic response. To elucidate differing metabolic states and their correlation with treatment response, we have developed a vascular-based 3D pipeline for whole slide images (WSI). In this presentation, we share details of the pipeline, provide quantitative results to validate its performance, and share the challenges experienced and the solutions created to manage and process WSIs.}
