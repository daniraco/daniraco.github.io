  abstract={This thesis addresses the problem of automatic analysis of neuronal tree morphology: from detection, modeling to digital reconstruction of tubular branches of neurites from 3D Light Microscopy image stacks. Comprehending the complex structure and connections of the neurons is key to the study of brain development and functioning. Advances in neuro-imaging has enabled us to capture such neuronal morphology in previously unimaginable details. The huge volume of rich and heterogeneous data generated, however, makes expert manual analysis of such images tedious, subjective and prohibitively expensive. Thus, robust, scalable and highly automated algorithms are desired to analyze such data. In this thesis, we propose a framework for automated quantification of neuronal morphometrics. We target three important methodological areas of biomedical image analysis.First, we present an automated, unsupervised object detection framework using stochastic marked point processes. We propose special configurations of marked objects and an energy function well adapted for vessel-like tubular structure networks. It incorporates both radiometric properties and high level structural constraints into a probabilistic formulation and global optimization scheme. This enables extraction of connected neuronal networks by fitting an optimal configuration of spheres to the centreline of the branches giving us the position, local width and orientation information.}
