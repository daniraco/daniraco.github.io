  abstract={This study aims at evaluating the accuracy of mitosis detection on multispectral histopathological images by developing a solution specifically designed to take advantage of multi-spectral information. The proposed framework includes a selection of spectral bands and focal plane, detection of candidate mitotic regions, computation of morphological \& mul-tispectral statistical features (MMSF) and study of different state-of-the-art classification methods for mitosis classification. This framework achieved 74% TPR, 76% PPV and 74% F-Measure on MITOS dataset. Our results indicate that selected multispectral bands contain discriminant information for mitotic figures, being therefore a very promising exploration area to improve the quality of the diagnosis assistance in histopathology.}
