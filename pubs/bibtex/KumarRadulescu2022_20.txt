  abstract={Hypoxia, a state of insufficient oxygen availability, is a hallmark of tumor microenvironment and affects multiple cellular pathways and contributes to tumor progression, invasiveness, angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry (D’Aguanno et al. 2021). Hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which mediates the expression of genes regulating metabolic pathways, pH regulation, DNA replication, protein synthesis and phenotypic switch from proliferative to invasive, resulting in intratumor heterogeneity, which hinders accurate diagnosis (D. S. Widmer et al. 2013, A. Tameemi et al., 2019). Moreover, hypoxia influences the response of cancer cells to various treatments, especially radiation therapy. Hence, presence of hypoxia is a clear indication of poor prognosis for patients with various cancer types including cutaneous melanoma, which is one of the most aggressive, complex, and heterogeneous cancers (B. Bedogni et al. 2009, T. Grzywa et al. 2017). Accurate assessments of oxygen and hypoxia distributions in the tumor microenvironment would be helpful for the prognostic evaluation and therapeutic options.Although there are plenty of theoretical and computational models for the oxygen distribution in the literature for various tumors, the novelty of this work lies in incorporating theoretical hypotheses to the actual tumor samples and in addressing the corresponding issues. We propose mathematical and computational frameworks to understand and mimic the spatial heterogeneity of oxygen partial pressure distribution and resulting hypoxia in the microenvironment of melanoma and other tumor samples …}
