  abstract={This paper introduces a modular modeling approach for distributed production systems, considering the production and maintenance processes synchronization. The production job shop, preventive and curative specialized tele-maintenance actions are studied. Stochastic synchronized Petri nets are used for modeling. This tool was adapted to the tele-maintenance distributed case and to integrate distant communications, synchronization problems and execution scheduling. Performance evaluation was performed using Markov Processes and Monte Carlo simulation.}
