  abstract={Narrowing the semantic gap represents one of the most outstanding challenges in medical image analysis and indexing. This paper introduces a medical knowledge - guided paradigm for semantic indexing of histopathology images, applied to breast cancer grading (BCG). Our method improves pathologists' current manual procedures consistency by employing a semantic indexing technique, according to a rule-based decision system related to Nottingham BCG system. The challenge is to move from the medical concepts/ rules related to the BCG, to the computer vision (CV) concepts and symbolic rules, to design a future generic framework- following Web Ontology Language standards - for an semi- automatic generation of CV rules. The effectiveness of this approach was experimentally validated over six breast cancer cases consisting of 7000 frames with domain knowledge from experts of Singapore National …}
