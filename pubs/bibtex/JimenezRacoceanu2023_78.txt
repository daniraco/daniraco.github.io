  abstract={ Recently, high-performance deep learning models have enabled automatic and precise analysis of medical images with high content. In digital histopathology, a challenge lies in analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSI) due to their large size, often requiring splitting them into smaller patches for deep learning models. This leads to the loss of global tissue information and limits the classification or clustering of patients based on tissue characteristics.  }
