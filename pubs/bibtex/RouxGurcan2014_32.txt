  abstract={Nottingham Grading System is an international grading system for breast cancer recommended by the World Health Organization. It is derived from the assessment of three morphological features: architecture (tubule formation), nuclear atypia (also known as nuclear polymorphism) and mitotic count. Several studies on automatic tools to process digitized slides have been reported focusing mainly on nuclei or tubule detection. Mitosis detection is a challenging problem and has not been addressed well in the literature. This contest is a unique initiative that provides a database of digitized microscopic images where mitosis have been annotated. As of July 15th, 2012, we had 129 companies, research institutes or universities in 40 countries that requested to register to the contest. This proves there is a real interest and a need for such a database.Mitotic count is an important parameter, possibly the most important one, in cancer grading in general, and in breast cancer grading in particular, as it gives an evaluation of the aggressiveness of the tumour. Detection of mitosis is a very challenging task since mitosis are small objects with a large variety of shape configurations. The four main phases of a mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. The shape and texture of the nucleus are very different from a phase of the mitosis to another phase, and also within the same phase, which makes the challenge very difficult.}
