  abstract={We introduce a new neural network architecture corresponding to the dynamic RBF with an elliptic influence field. The dynamic aspect is obtained with a self-connection, and the elliptic influence field form, by adding a supplementary RBF layer. The modified RBF neural network gives good results in monitoring applications.}
