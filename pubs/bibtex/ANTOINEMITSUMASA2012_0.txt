  abstract={The study of biopsy micrographs from surgically extracted breast tumors is currently the gold standard for the assessment of breast cancer and is performed routinely in daily clinical practice. This task known as Breast Cancer Grading (BCG) provides essential prognostic and management information for the pathology. Therefore, a good grading has a great impact on the quality of the medical care and the reduction of human and financial costs due to misdiagnosis. Unfortunately, BCG is a highly qualified job requiring a large amount of work from experienced pathologists. Moreover, the tedious nature of the task makes it prone to frequent errors. Many specialized and repetitive tasks such as BCG could greatly benefit from a partial or full automatization. Nevertheless, they often require the knowledge and experience of highly-qualified specialists which is not simple to model. Therefore, powerful methods able to extract and model the complex know-how of specialists accomplishing complex tasks are necessary.Support Vector Machines (SVM) with their numerous variants for classification and regression tasks are state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms which can be used for this purpose. Some of their key features are the absence of local optima, the possibility to control over-fitting and the use of kernels. In combination with the nonlinear Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, they provide a powerful and versatile learning tool often used as a default choice in many real-world applications. SVMs are supervised statistical learning algorithms: they work by extracting the 1}
