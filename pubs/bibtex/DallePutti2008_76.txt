  abstract={Breast cancer grading of histopathological images is the standard clinical practice for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer development. In a large hospital, a pathologist typically handles 100 grading cases per day, each consisting of about 2000 image frames. It is, therefore, a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a method for automatic computer grading to assist pathologists by providing second opinions and reducing their workload. It combines the three criteria in the Nottingham scoring system using a multi-resolution approach. To our best knowledge, there is no existing work that provide complete grading according to the Nottingham criteria.}
