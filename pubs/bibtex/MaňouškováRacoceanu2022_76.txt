  abstract={Tau proteins in the gray matter are widely known to be a part of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms. They can aggregate in three different structures within the brain: neurites, tangles, and neuritic plaques. The morphology and the spatial disposition of these three aggregates are hypothesised to be correlated to the advancement of the disease. In order to establish a behavioural disease model related to the Tau proteins aggregates, it is necessary to develop algorithms to detect and segment them automatically. We present a 5-folded pipeline aiming to perform with clinically operational results. This pipeline is composed of a non-linear colour normalisation, a CNN-based image classifier, an Unet-based image segmentation stage, and a morphological analysis of the segmented objects. The tangle detection and segmentation algorithms improve state-of-the-art performances (75.8% and 91.1% F1- score, respectively …}
