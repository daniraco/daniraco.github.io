  abstract={Visual inspection of hepatocellular carcinoma cancer regions by experienced pathologists in whole-slide images (WSIs) is a challenging, labor-intensive, and time-consuming task because of the large scale and high resolution of WSIs. Therefore, a weakly supervised framework based on a multiscale attention convolutional neural network (MSAN-CNN) was introduced into this process. Herein, patch-based images with image-level normal/tumor annotation (rather than images with pixel-level annotation) were fed into a classification neural network. To further improve the performances of cancer region detection, multiscale attention was introduced into the classification neural network. A total of 100 cases were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and divided into 70 training and 30 testing data sets that were fed into the MSAN-CNN framework. The experimental results showed that this framework significantly …}
