  abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of manual semi-automated and volumetric measurements to assess prostate cancer volume on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) using whole-mount histopathology for validation.We evaluated 30 consecutive men (median age, 65.7 years; interquartile range [IQR], 61.5–70.9 years) with a median prostatic specific antigen of 8.5 ng/dL (IQR, 5.5–10.5 ng/dL), who underwent MP-MRI before radical prostatectomy. Index tumor volume was determined prospectively and independently on the basis of MRI and whole-mount section volumetric assessment using the maximum histologic diameter (MHD) and the histologic volume (HV). The MRI index tumor volume was determined by two independent radiologists using a single measurement of the maximum tumor dimension (MTD), a simplified MR ellipsoid volume …}
