  abstract={The complexity of real production systems implies more difficulties to make an efficient fault diagnosis. We propose a new method that helps the operator to find the cause and the origin of a fault. To obtain a diagnosis aid system that is both reactive and easy to configure, we define a set of artificial intelligence tools using neuro-fuzzy techniques. The interest of these techniques is to combine the ability to learn of neural networks and the natural language formalism of the fuzzy logic.}
